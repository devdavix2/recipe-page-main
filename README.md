## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts for typography

### What I Learned

While working on this project, I gained a better understanding of structuring semantic HTML for a recipe page. I also improved my CSS layout skills using Flexbox. Below are some code snippets Iâ€™m proud of:

#### HTML Example:

```html
<div class="ingredients">
  <h4 class="title">Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
    <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
    <li>Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

#### CSS Example:

```css

.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  padding: 30px;
  border-radius: 30px;
  width: 700px;
  margin-top: 40px;
  margin-bottom: 100px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.re
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Experiment with CSS Grid for more complex layouts
- Improve accessibility features, such as ARIA labels
- Optimize the page for faster loading by compressing images
